**This repository has code for both Task2 and Task3.**

#### ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION:
The assignment requires the completion of the below requirements:  

**1.Write a program in JAVA to perform the following operation: If a number is divisible by 3 it should print “Consultadd” as a string**  
●	If a number is divisible by 5 it should print “JAVA Training” as a string  
●	If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5 its should print “Consultadd JAVA Training” as a string.  

**2. Write a program in JAVA to perform the following operator based task:**  
●	Ask the user to choose the following option first:  
○	If User Enter 1 - Addition   
○	If User Enter 2 - Subtraction  
○	If User Enter 3 - Division  
○	If User Enter 4 - Multiplication   
○	If User Enter 5 - Average  
●	Ask the user to enter the 2 numbers in a variable for first and second(first and second are variable names) for the first 4 options mentioned above and print the result.  
●	Ask the user to enter two more numbers as first1 and second2 for calculating the average as soon as the user chooses an option 5.  
●	In the end, if the answer of any operation is Negative print a statement saying “Oops option X(1/2/3/4/5/) is returning the negative number”  
●	NOTE: At a time users can perform one action at a time.  

**3. Write a program in JAVA to implement a particular flowchart.**  
 
**4. Write a program in JAVA to break and continue if the following cases occur:**  
●	If the user enters a negative number just break the loop and print “It’s Over”  
●	If the user enters a positive number just continue in the loop and print “Good Going”  

**5. Write a program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6**  
       Expected output: 0 1 2 4 5  
       
**6.Given an integer, perform the following conditional actions:**   
●	If  is odd, print NEW  
●	If  is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print OLD  
●	If  is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 30, print NEW  
●	If  is even and greater than 30, print OLD  

**7.Write a Java program that reads a floating-point number and prints "zero" if the number is zero. Otherwise, print "positive" or "negative". Add "small" if the absolute value of the number is less than 1, or "large" if it exceeds 1,000,000.**   

**8.Write a JAVA program which takes character input from the user,
●	If the character is from r, a, n, d, o, m (consider both upper and lower cases), then print FOUND.  
●	Print NOT FOUND for all the other alphabets.**  

**TASK THREE : LOOPING STATEMENTS**  

**1. Write a simple program to print multiplication table of a certain number taken from user**    
For eg. 2 X 1 = 2  
2 X 2 = 4  
and so on.  
**3. Write a program in which:  
•	Take 10 values input from user using loop.  
•	Print sum of all the numbers provided  
•	Print the Average of those 10 values  

**4. Write a JAVA program that takes user input from 1 to 12 for months, and display number of days of a particular month. (Shows “Invalid Details“ if incorrect month number will be provided). **   

**5.	Write a JAVA program that takes one integer input n from the user, and display all the so, print sum of n natural numbers.** 

**6.	Write a JAVA program that takes long type input from user, and**   
•	Calculate and display the number of digits.  
•	Calculate the sum of all the digits of the input.  

**7.	Write a program that accepts three numbers from the user and prints "INCREASING" if the numbers are in increasing order, "DECREASING" if the numbers are in decreasing order, and   "Neither increasing or decreasing order" otherwise. FOR eg**  .    
•	Input first number: 1524  
•	Input second number: 2345  
•	Input third number: 3321  
Output :  
INCREASING  

**8.	Write a Java program to find the number of days in a month.**   
Test Data    
Input a month number: 2  
Input a year: 2016  
Expected Output :  
February 2016 has 29 days  

**9.	Write a Java program that takes a year from user and print whether that year is a leap year or not.**  
**10.	Write a program in Java to display the pattern like right angle triangle with a number.**    
Test Data  
Input number of rows : 10  
Expected Output :  
1  
12  
123  
1234  
12345  
123456  
1234567  
12345678   
123456789  
12345678910  

**10.	Write a J program to display Pascal's triangle.**  
Test Data  
Input number of rows: 5  
Expected Output :  
Input number of rows: 5  
1  
1 1  
1 2 1  
1 3 3 1  
1 4 6 4 1  

**11.	Write a Java program that accepts two floating point numbers and checks whether they are the same up to two decimal places**
